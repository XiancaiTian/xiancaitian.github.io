title: About Me 关于我
---

I am a data analyst with great passion for data-driven decision making. I have worked on data-powered projects including web-based data visualisation systems, data visualisations, BI automation and data mining (mainly intelligent transportation related) projects.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading good books, watching quality movies, photography, and sports (mainly running and body building).
